            My aim is to design a fully personalised AI tutor. What you are about to see is the first prototype.
            Your feedack on this prototype is invaluable to its future development. There are a few things to bear in mind:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-6">
            <li>This prototype teaches only one topic</li>
            <li>This is a bare bones prototype
            <li>At this stage I am mainly looking for feedback on how well the tutor teaches</li>
            <li>But any other ideas you have related to design, use of AI or whatever you can think of are also greatly appreciated!</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-6">
            You may find this lesson quite basic. If that is the case, consider it from the perspective of a child when giving your feedback.
